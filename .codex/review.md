# Code Review Instructions

Source basis: synthesized from <https://claude.com/blog/code-review>. Do not treat this file as a copy of the article; it is the repo's operational review guide.

## Before Reviewing

- Read the issue summary, acceptance criteria, PR description, and full PR diff.
- For GitHub PRs or issues, use the local `gh` CLI for metadata, comments, checks, and diffs. Do not rely on public web access for private or permission-restricted repositories.
- Identify the changed surfaces, adjacent code that the diff depends on, and any external contracts affected by the change.
- If the PR crosses a repo boundary — `services/librechat`, submodule pointers, dispatch workflows, or merge sequencing — also check the relevant repo-boundary and external-review docs.
- Use repository documents as review evidence **only** when the PR links or names the relevant document/section, or when you independently discover directly relevant repo context while tracing the changed surface. Do not infer hidden design intent from unrelated repository documents, and do not treat a linked design doc as a reason to pass a change you cannot verify from the diff.
- Read the **linked issue's acceptance criteria** before judging correctness; a "does not satisfy the contract" finding must be checked against the actual AC reachable from the PR, not an assumed contract.
- Read the PR body's `## Verification dispositions` list and judge each stated reason: every issue acceptance criterion not verified by an automated test appears there with its disposition and a one-line reason. A reduction whose stated reason does not hold — an `existing-coverage` claim naming a mechanism that does not fail on that property, a `none` whose absence in fact costs something, a `manual` scenario that does not exist — is a finding. A reduction whose reason does hold is not a finding, and the absence of a test is not a finding on its own.

## Review Posture

- Optimize for depth over speed. The review should catch issues a skim would miss.
- Treat the review as a bug-finding pass, not a style pass or general advice pass.
- Look for concrete bugs, regressions, security issues, data loss risks, broken contracts, and missing tests.
- Scale review depth with PR size and complexity: trivial PRs get a lightweight pass; large, risky, or cross-boundary PRs get deeper inspection of adjacent code and failure paths.
- Do not merge, close issues, or perform release/deployment actions as part of review. These actions are outside the review role.
- Do not submit an approval or request-changes review state unless the user explicitly asks for that review state.
- Keep style, naming, and preference feedback out of blocking findings unless it creates a real maintainability or correctness risk.
- Write the entire review output — the summary, every finding, and all prose — in Korean (한글). Keep code identifiers, file paths, command names, and the severity labels (`Critical`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low`) in English. This applies to both terminal output and any comment posted to a PR.

## Review Method

- Search for possible bugs from multiple angles in parallel: changed behavior, adjacent dependencies, tests, security, operational flow, and user-facing contracts.
- Verify each suspected bug before reporting it. Trace the code path, compare it with the issue or PR claim, and check whether tests would catch it.
- Review against the intended contract and realistic failure modes; do not expand the contract merely because a stricter invariant can be imagined.
- Filter false positives aggressively. If the evidence is weak, move the item to `Low Confidence` or omit it.
- Rank confirmed findings by severity and user impact.
- Produce one high-signal overview instead of many scattered observations.
- Add inline-comment candidates only when a finding maps to a specific changed line.
- After completing a GitHub PR review, post the review result back to the PR using the local `gh` CLI unless the user explicitly says not to comment.
- Posting a review comment is allowed by default.
- After posting the PR review comment, remove the `blocked-by-review` label from the PR when there are no confirmed `Critical`, `High`, or `Medium` findings. This is a required review-completion step because the label acts as a pipeline gate. Run it for externally triggered reviews as well as interactive reviews. Do not remove the label when any confirmed `Critical`, `High`, or `Medium` finding remains. Follow this procedure in order: (1) **Primary** — `gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --remove-label blocked-by-review` (for a sub-repo PR add `--repo <owner/name>`). (2) **Fallback on primary failure** — `gh issue edit <PR_NUMBER> --remove-label blocked-by-review` (sub-repo PR: add `--repo <owner/name>`); a PR is an issue in GitHub's data model, so the Issues-API surface removes the same label when the PR-edit surface fails on the Projects-classic GraphQL deprecation path — a different API surface, not a same-command retry (verified working, LibreChat PR #194, exit 0). (3) **Verification (required before reporting either outcome)** — run `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json labels` (sub-repo: add `--repo <owner/name>`) and confirm `blocked-by-review` is absent from the returned labels; report success only if verification shows the label gone. If label removal fails, report the failure clearly and do not claim that the review workflow completed successfully. This label removal is authorized here because the reviewer runs in the configured isolated reviewer subprocess: for the `codex` backend the orchestrator-side PreToolUse hook deny on `--remove-label` intercepts only the orchestrator's Bash tool, not this subprocess; for the `claude` backend the subprocess additionally runs in a neutral cwd with the parent session's `CLAUDE*` env scrubbed and `--setting-sources ""`, so it never loads the AutoFlow gate hook at all — not from project settings (excluded by the neutral cwd), not from a parent-session re-attach (a nested Claude Code session otherwise re-attaches to the parent project and loads that hook despite the neutral cwd — witnessed on PR #981), and not from the user-scope plugin (`enabledPlugins autoflow@autoflow`, whose hooks otherwise load in every session regardless of cwd/env — excluded by `--setting-sources ""`). Either way the reviewer is the sole authorized clearer.
- After posting the PR review comment, **attach** the `blocked-by-review` label to the PR when at least one confirmed `Critical`, `High`, or `Medium` finding remains **and** the label is currently absent from the PR. The label is attached at PR creation and removed on a clean review, so a PR whose earlier round was clean carries no gate; without this re-attach a later `Critical`/`High`/`Medium` finding would be handed to external review with no gate signal at all. This clause and the removal clause above are mutually exclusive by construction — removal requires **zero** confirmed `Critical`/`High`/`Medium` findings, attach requires **at least one** — so one review never performs both. Follow this procedure in order: (1) **Primary** — `gh pr edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label blocked-by-review` (for a sub-repo PR add `--repo <owner/name>`). (2) **Fallback on primary failure** — `gh issue edit <PR_NUMBER> --add-label blocked-by-review` (sub-repo PR: add `--repo <owner/name>`); a PR is an issue in GitHub's data model, so the Issues-API surface writes the same label when the PR-edit surface fails — a different API surface, not a same-command retry. (3) **Verification (required before reporting either outcome)** — run `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json labels` (sub-repo: add `--repo <owner/name>`) and confirm `blocked-by-review` is **present** in the returned labels; report success only if verification shows the label attached. If the verification read still shows the label absent after both surfaces were tried, the label most likely does not exist in that repository — a fallback cannot help, because no surface can attach a label the repo does not define. Report that condition explicitly as an operator setup gap (the label must be created in each repo per `docs/external-review-sequencing.md` > Operator prerequisites) and do not claim the review workflow completed successfully. Never create the label yourself; label creation stays operator-owned. This attach is authorized on the same ground as the removal clause above — the reviewer runs in the configured isolated reviewer subprocess. Authority over this gate label is directional: the reviewer is the **sole** authority for **removal** (the orchestrator is hook-denied), while **attach** is **reviewer-primary with an orchestrator backstop** — the orchestrator re-attaches only when the reviewer's own attach did not land, and an attach made in error is undone by a reviewer re-review, never by the orchestrator. That backstop attach and its recovery route (a re-run of the step-6 review clears the label) are described in `docs/autoflow-guide.md` HANDOFF step 6.5.
- Submitting an approval or request-changes review state requires explicit user instruction.
- Merging, closing issues, and deploying are not allowed during review.

## Review Lenses

1. Security
- Authentication bypass
- Authorization or permission errors
- Secret leakage
- Injection or unsafe input handling
- Unsafe command execution

2. Correctness and Regression
- Behavior that no longer satisfies the issue or PR claims
- Broken API routes, schema contracts, config names, or feature flags
- State, retry, idempotency, race, rollback, and error-path bugs
- Adjacent-code assumptions invalidated by the diff

3. Tests
- Missing acceptance-criteria coverage
- Missing edge cases around failure, rollback, permissions, and boundary inputs
- Tests that assert mocks instead of the real runtime contract
- Flaky or environment-dependent tests introduced by the change

4. Architecture
- Layer violations
- Dependency direction problems
- Cross-repo or submodule boundary violations
- Runtime behavior that contradicts documented operational flow

5. Performance
- N+1 calls
- Expensive loops or repeated work on hot paths
- Unbounded queries, payloads, or memory growth

## Output Format

All section bodies below are written in Korean (한글); only the section headers, severity labels, code identifiers, and paths stay in English.

# Review Summary

A concise overview of the review result. State whether the PR has blocking findings, non-blocking findings, missing tests, or no material issues found.

# Findings

List confirmed findings first, ranked by severity. For each finding include:

- Severity: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`
- File and line reference
- What breaks
- Why it breaks, with code-path evidence
- Suggested fix direction

# Inline Comment Candidates

Only include comments that should be placed on specific changed lines. Keep each comment focused on the concrete bug at that line.

# Missing Tests

List specific test gaps only when they materially affect confidence in the changed behavior.

# Low Confidence

Potential issues that need maintainer confirmation or more context.

If there are no findings in a section, say `None`.

## Legacy Mapping

If another workflow asks for the older local categories, map them as follows:

- `Must Fix`: `Critical` and `High` confirmed findings
- `Should Fix`: `Medium` and `Low` confirmed findings
- `Missing Tests`: same as above
- `Low Confidence`: same as above
